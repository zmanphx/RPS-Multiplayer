RPS  (Rock paper Scissors) multiplayer game using  Firebase database 

I am using  jquery animiation on the image buttons. When the player enters their name the 3 images appear.
When the player picks one of the  button images as their choice the button dissappears. 
Also included is a chat feature to push method to add new chat text. The chat function has to get the latest
message created and populated the  html element . 
 I created in advanced the structure of the database using a JSON object import.  
All  new data is written using the Update method to an existing JSON object data structure.
